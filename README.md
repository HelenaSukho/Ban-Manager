Hey, i am learning python and i tried myself on tkinter after several attempts and youtube videos.
This application may seem useless since it has no affect like sharing the banlist with other people (maybe streamers).
It was for me a way to train myself a bit with tkinters grid and frame method. I also had some steps into json file save.
Most of the time this application was written by myself. I only had to use Chatgpt to get some teaching into json, how to extract keys and values
out of a dictionary. 

Inside this repository you will find the .py file to it. I maybe will improve it along the way when i get better with python and tkinter.
